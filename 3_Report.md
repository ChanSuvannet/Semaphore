## 1. Introduction

The **Bank ATM System Simulation** project simulates a real-world ATM scenario where multiple customers concurrently access a fixed number of ATMs. This project demonstrates the usage of **semaphores** for controlling access to limited resources and simulating concurrent operations in a multithreaded environment.

The simulation mimics how customers interact with ATMs to perform transactions such as checking balances, depositing funds, and withdrawing money. By utilizing Java's **Semaphore** mechanism, the system ensures that a fixed number of customers can use the ATMs at any given time.

## 2. System Overview

The **Bank ATM System** consists of the following main components:

- **ATM**: Represents the ATM machine, providing methods to simulate real-world transactions like balance check, deposit, and withdrawal.
- **Account**: Represents a customer's bank account, tracking their balance and allowing deposits and withdrawals.
- **Customer**: Represents each customer as a thread. Each customer interacts with an ATM to perform a transaction.
- **Semaphore**: Controls access to the ATM, ensuring that no more than a specified number of customers can use it simultaneously.

### Key Functionalities:
- Multiple customers can access ATMs concurrently, but only a limited number of ATMs are available.
- The ATM simulates transactions and ensures thread safety by synchronizing access to shared resources.
- The **Semaphore** is used to restrict the number of simultaneous ATM users.

## 3. Architecture & Design

### 3.1 System Components

- **ATM Class**: Manages the ATM usage. Customers interact with this class to perform transactions.
- **Account Class**: Holds the balance and provides methods to deposit, withdraw, and check balance.
- **Customer Class**: Represents a customer who uses the ATM. Each customer runs as a separate thread to simulate concurrent behavior.
- **Semaphore**: A concurrency control mechanism used to manage the number of customers using the ATM simultaneously.

```

## 4. Features

- **Concurrency Control**: Ensures that only a limited number of customers can use the ATM at a time.
- **Multithreading**: Each customer runs in its own thread, simulating real-world concurrency.
- **Thread Synchronization**: Uses a **Semaphore** to synchronize access to the ATM, avoiding race conditions.
- **Realistic Transactions**: Simulates deposit, withdrawal, and balance checks.
- **User Interaction**: Customers can perform transactions interactively.

## 5. Testing

### 5.1 Manual Testing

Manual testing was conducted to simulate various scenarios:
- **ATM Access**: Multiple customers (threads) tried to access the ATM, and only the allowed number of concurrent customers were able to perform transactions at the same time.
- **Transactions**: Customers performed deposit, withdrawal, and balance check operations, and the balance was updated accordingly.
- **Concurrency**: Verified that the ATM only allowed a limited number of customers at once, simulating real-world waiting times for ATM access.

### 5.2 Automated Testing

The project also includes unit tests using **JUnit** to ensure correctness:

- **Account Class**: Tests for deposit, withdrawal, and balance checking. Verifies that funds are correctly updated and that an insufficient funds withdrawal attempt is handled.
  
  Example:
  ```java
  @Test
  void testDeposit() {
      Account account = new Account(1000);
      account.deposit(500);
      assertEquals(1500, account.getBalance(), "Balance should be updated after deposit.");
  }
  ```

- **ATM Class**: Ensures that customers are able to use the ATM concurrently and correctly handle the number of ATM users.

- **Customer Class**: Verifies that each customer is able to perform transactions and that the account balance is updated accordingly.

### 5.3 Test Results

- **Account**: All tests passed for deposit, withdrawal, and balance checking.
- **ATM**: The ATM correctly manages concurrent customers, allowing a limited number of customers to use the ATM at a time.
- **Customer**: The customer transaction system correctly interacts with the ATM, performing various operations like deposit and withdrawal.

## 6. Conclusion

This **Bank ATM System Simulation** project successfully demonstrates concurrency control in Java using **semaphores**. The system simulates real-world ATM usage where multiple customers interact with a limited number of ATMs. By using **multithreading** and **semaphores**, the system ensures thread safety and efficient resource management.

### Key Takeaways:
- **Concurrency Management**: Using semaphores to limit access to shared resources.
- **Multithreading**: Handling multiple threads (customers) concurrently in a system.
- **Realistic Simulation**: Simulating ATM operations with transaction processing and customer interactions.

### Future Enhancements:
- Integrating a graphical user interface (GUI) to visualize the ATM usage.
- Adding additional transaction types (e.g., transferring funds between accounts).
- Implementing dynamic ATM availability and maintenance schedules.
